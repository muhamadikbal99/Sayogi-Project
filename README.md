## Features

- Detects fruits and vegetables in real-time using the camera.
- Provides a detection score to help users make informed decisions.
- Easy-to-use interface with clear instructions.

## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Roboflow and consists of 3851 images with 24 classes. The dataset can be accessed from the following link:
